I have come across many different forms such as comment boxes, subscription forms, registration forms, customer feedback forms, account sign-up forms, etc. They each serve different purposes but overall they all seek to gain information.
<ul>
<li>Text Input - Password Box for a website</li>
<li>Selection Input - Checkbox asking to check which option applies to you in a medical survey</li>
<li>Upload Button - used when you are uploading an assignment to moodle</li>
My work cycle of this assignment included more focus on reading all the material first and then going back and forth between the text and the assignment to complete each step fully and correctly.
