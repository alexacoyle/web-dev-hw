<p>I learned an immense amount about web development from this class. I did not have much background in this before the class so this was all new material/knowledge to me. I learned how to use github most effectively for me. It was interesting to learn how atom, github, and the live web worked together to create our websites. </p>
<br>
<p>Everything I learned in this class was new to me as I had not had past experience with design. I learned how to use different fonts, basic, and unique ones from google, to make a website unique and applicable to the content. I also learned how to incorporate colors in different elements of the website to make it easier for the viewers to see, and to make the page more visually interesting and stimulating.</p>
<br>
<p>My work cycle for this assignment was actually much easier then most as all the elements required I have already learned and done in other assignments. I went back and forth between the assignment requirements, my atom page, and past assignments to piece together the elements I needed to complete the assignment. I used the elements I took from my past assignments and made them unique to the content of my final page.</p>
