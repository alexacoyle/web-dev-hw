<p>Documents can have as many <head> and <body> elements as long as they are properly opened and closed. Within the <head> there are Meta elements which include charset, description, and author as well as viewport. Charset defines the character set to use for page display, description is a description of the page, author defines the author of the webpage, and viewport gives the visible area of a web page.</p>
<p>Structural Markup includes information about the structure of the document such as headings, paragraphs, breaks and lists. Semantic Markup is used to reinforce the semantics, or meaning of the information in a document.</p>
<p>This assignment required much work and small details. My work cycle for this assignment included going back and forth between the lesson and my work, completing the assignment pieces as I read/learned about them from the text.</p>
