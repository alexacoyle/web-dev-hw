<h4>Lyrics</h4>
<div id="lyrics" class="container-1" class="lyrics-2">
<p>
This beat is <br>
Automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh <br>
Work my body, so melodic, this beat goes right through my chest <br>
Everybody, ma and papi, came to party <br>
Grab somebody, work ya body, work ya body <br>
Let me see you one, two step <br>
Rock it, don't stop it <br>
Everybody get on the floor <br>
Crank the party up <br>
We about to get it on <br>
Let me see you one, two step <br>
I love it when you one, two step <br>
Everybody one, two step <br>
We about to get it on <br>
This beat is <br>
Outrageous, so contagious, make you crave it <br>
Jazze made it <br>
So retarded, top-charted, ever since the day I started <br>
Strut my stuff and yes I flaunt it <br>
Goodies make the boys jump on it <br>
No I can't control myself <br>
Now let me do my one, two step <br>
Rock it, don't stop it <br>
Everybody get on the floor <br>
Crank the party up <br>
We about to get it on <br>
Let me see you one, two step <br>
I love it when you one, two step <br>
Everybody one, two step <br>
We about to get it on <br>
We gon' drop it like this <br>
It don't matter to me, we can dance slow <br>
Whichever way the beat drops, our bodies will go <br>
So swing it over here Mr. DJ <br>
And we will, we will, rock you <br>
It don't matter to me, we can dance slow <br>
Whichever way the beat drops, our bodies will go <br>
So swing it over here Mr. DJ <br>
And we will, we will, rock you <br>
I shake it like Jello, make the boys say "hello" <br>
Cause they know I'm rockin' the beat <br>
I know you heard about a lot of great MC's <br>
But they ain't got nothin' on me <br>
Because I'm five foot two, I wanna dance with you <br>
And I'm sophisticated fun, I eat fillet Mignon <br>
And I'm nice and young, best believe I'm number one <br>
Rock it, don't stop it <br>
Everybody get on the floor <br>
Crank the party up <br>
We about to get it on <br>
Let me see you one, two step <br>
I love it when you one, two step <br>
Everybody one, two step <br>
We about to get it on <br>
Rock it, don't stop it <br>
Everybody get on the floor <br>
Crank the party up <br>
We about to get it on <br>
Let me see you one, two step <br>
I love it when you one, two step <br>
Everybody one, two step <br>
We about to get it on <br>
