The difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans is that divs are primarily very good for element groups referred to as "block-level element", ids use unique identifiers called an id attribute, classes are another type of identifier but groups similar elements together by using the same name, and spans are very similar to divs, but are used for content that requires organization or certain styling. <br>
Alt Text refers to alternative text such as images, and other alternative forms of text in HTML. We use it so we can incorporate these other unique forms of text in web design. <br>
This assignment was the most difficult one in my opinion. Learning the different aspects of images, videos, and audio and how to incorporate that into web design and HTML was challenging and less straightforward. My work cycle consisted of reading through the lesson and taking notes as well as going back and forth between the assignment and the text to incorporate new things learned into the assignment. <br>
