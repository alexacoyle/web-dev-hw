<p>My imaginary client was Larry with Larry lawn care. He described his needs as an easy to use informational site that highlights their services. They wanted to include simple green color (like grass), and emphasized simplicity and accessibility for viewers.</p>

<p> The difference between block, inline, and inline block displays is that inline rule forces elements to act like inline elements as they only take up as much horizontal space as needed, don't force new lines, and "flow" with the content of the page. Inline block removes new lines inherent in block elements but forces elements to respect margin and vertical spacing properties/rules. Lastly block displays is what can be used to turn into inline or inline-block, and it often used for the dropdown menu. </p>

<p>My work cycle for this assignment may have been the most difficult one. There were many aspects to this assignment as it is the "final" website incorporating all aspects we have learned. I went back and forth between past assignments, text examples, and my work to piece together each aspect.</p>
