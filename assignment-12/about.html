    <p>
      I have been personally managing and providing maintenance to residential properties for over 20 years.  I really enjoy working in the outdoors and helping people turn their landscaping visions into a reality.  I started doing lawns as a hobby, which grew into a small business, and now offer an array of landscaping services with a great crew.</p>
<br>

<p>I am a hardworking family man trying to set a good example for my kids to see, understand and hopefully one day follow.  My mission is to provide my customers with an excellent and dependable service, open communication and fair pricing.</p>

<br>

<p>I feel that my communication with customers is what sets me apart from my competitors.  I strongly believe open communication is not only necessary, but the foundation to a successful working relationship with my customers.</p>

<br>

<p>We always strive for customer satisfaction!</p>

<br>

<p>I would appreciate the opportunity to add you to our landscaping 'family'.
