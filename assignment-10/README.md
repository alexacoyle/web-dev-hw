<p>The difference between system fonts, web fonts, and web-safe fonts is that system fonts are already installed on the device, as web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server, and web-safe fonts are fonts that can be counted on to be available by most devices.</p>
<br>
<p>Fallback fonts are "second options" to the primary font chosen, and these are very important because they are there if for some reason the browser cannot load the primary choice.</p>

<p>My work cycle for this assignment included reading through all the material first and then going back when needed for each element involved in each step of the assignment. There were many small different elements involved with this assignment and many different ways you could achieve the same task.</p>
