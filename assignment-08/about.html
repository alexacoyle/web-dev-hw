For this project I chose banana scrambled eggs because this is my favorite breakfast recipe, and one that not many people know about. It has made a big impact on my eating habits as I eat very healthy for my sport and athletic performance.

<p>
I crave sweet foods in the morning opposed to savory tastes, but want to eliminate high sugar foods from my diet. This recipe provides a perfect sweet breakfast alternative, including all healthy ingredients with nutrients, protein, and no sugar.
