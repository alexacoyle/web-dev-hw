<p>My experience learning HTML was new, interesting, but also difficult. My favorite part of learning this material was creating the website through the HTML code and then going to see what you created entering the URL and being pleasantly surprised. This was a rewarding feeling. The most difficult part to learn was the media unit involving video and audio.</p>

<p> I am excited to learn how to "decorate" the web pages more to further advance my web design abilities. I am nervous for the learning of a new concept and the difficulties that brings, but am mostly excited!</p>

<p>This assignment was the one I am most proud of as it incorporated all the different pieces we have learned into one assignment. My work cycle consisted of going through each step of the assignment, and then referencing back to previous lessons and assignments to complete the steps.</p>
